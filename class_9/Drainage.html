                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Himalayan rivers and Peninsular rivers differ significantly in their characteristics due to their origin and physiographic conditions. Himalayan rivers originate from glaciers or snow-covered regions, making them perennial, meaning they have water throughout the year. Examples include the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra. These rivers have long courses, cut through mountains to form deep gorges, and perform intensive erosional activity in their upper courses. In their middle and lower courses, they form depositional features like meanders and oxbow lakes. Peninsular rivers, on the other hand, are mostly seasonal, depending on rainfall for their flow. They originate from the Peninsular plateau and have shorter courses. These rivers typically flow over hard rocks and form waterfalls and rapids. Examples include the Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri. Understanding these differences is crucial for grasping the drainage systems in India.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    A drainage basin is the area drained by a single river system, including all its tributaries and distributaries. It is an essential geographical unit for understanding river systems. A water divide is an elevated area, such as a mountain or upland, that separates two drainage basins. For example, in India, the Western Ghats act as a water divide between rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea and those flowing into the Bay of Bengal. Drainage basins and water divides are significant as they influence the flow of rivers, water availability, and agricultural practices. They also play a role in determining the location of settlements and infrastructure development. India's drainage systems are broadly divided into the Himalayan and Peninsular systems, which are shaped by these geographical features.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    River pollution is primarily caused by human activities such as industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, sewage disposal, and urbanization. Industrial discharge often contains harmful chemicals and heavy metals that contaminate water bodies. Agricultural runoff introduces pesticides and fertilizers, leading to eutrophication and depletion of oxygen levels. Sewage disposal contributes to bacterial contamination, making water unsafe for consumption. Urbanization increases sedimentation and waste accumulation in rivers. The impact on aquatic ecosystems includes loss of biodiversity, disruption of food chains, and degradation of water quality, which affects both aquatic organisms and human populations relying on these water sources.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Oxbow lakes are formed as a result of the meandering process of rivers. When a river flows through its middle and lower courses, it tends to form large loops or bends due to erosion and deposition. Over time, the neck of the meander becomes narrower, and during floods or high water flow, the river cuts through the neck, creating a new, straighter channel. The abandoned meander loop is left as an isolated water body, called an oxbow lake. These lakes are significant as they provide habitats for various aquatic species, act as reservoirs for floodwaters, and contribute to the biodiversity of the region. Additionally, they are indicators of the dynamic nature of river systems and the processes of erosion and deposition.

                    The Himalayan rivers are perennial, meaning they have water throughout the year due to their sources in glaciers and snow-covered mountains. They have long courses from their source to the sea and perform intensive erosional activity in their upper courses, creating features such as gorges. In their middle and lower courses, they form depositional features like meanders and oxbow lakes. In contrast, Peninsular rivers are seasonal, primarily dependent on rainfall, and have shorter courses. They generally flow through plateaus and plains, forming waterfalls and not as many depositional features. This distinction is due to the physiographic differences between the Himalayas and the Peninsular region.

                    <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
                    Peninsular rivers are primarily seasonal, as their flow depends on rainfall. Unlike Himalayan rivers, which are perennial due to melting snow and glaciers, Peninsular rivers often dry up during non-monsoon periods. They have shorter courses and flow through relatively stable terrain, resulting in less erosional activity compared to the Himalayan rivers. Peninsular rivers generally originate from the Western Ghats and flow eastward to drain into the Bay of Bengal, with exceptions like the Narmada and Tapi rivers that flow westward. These rivers form broad valleys and deltas, but they lack features such as meanders and oxbow lakes, which are common in Himalayan rivers. This distinction highlights the influence of geography and climate on river systems in India.
